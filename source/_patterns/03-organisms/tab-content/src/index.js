/**
 * This is the entry point of our widget. It doesn't know/care that it may be
 * used in Drupal, Grav, Pattern Lab, Wordpress, etc. It's just an app that
 * needs a piece of DOM to which to attach.
 *
 * Note that it exports a simple interface and also prevents itself from
 * running if the attach point is not visible on the page.
 *
 * The widget uses Redux to manage state, and jQuery to make AJAX calls and
 * HTML. A future iteration of this widget should use combineReducers() from
 * Redux to allow *all* widgets to share a single state tree.
